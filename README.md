# Quantum Chaos

This repository is for the study of quantum chaos, the topics temporarily include random matrix theory, OTOC(out-of-time-order correlation), quantum information scrambling and their implication to generic quantum circuits and solvable models.

Hope the road to quantum chaos is bright and successful!
